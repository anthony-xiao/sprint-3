What is you site's primary purpose?
    To allow the others to understand who I am and see my work. Being able to show them work history.
Who is your target audience?
    Peers and possibly future employees
How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?
    I would like the visitors to have an easy experience, it is easy to know where they want to go, how to get there, and be able to switch locations with minimal effort. Also to make sure the site is clearn and not clustered with different things
How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?
    The first step will be taking into account responsive design, designing the site so users from mobile to desktop are able to have a good experience.
    Make sure that I use the F theory to allow the most important information to be in the most convenient positions. 
    Don't try to do too much with the site, make sure what is done is done well and tidy, because as the site grows we do not want to accumulate debt. 
    Use the lessons learnt about planning, go from site map, wireframes, black and white design and so on.
    Learn from the firs time around and make sure the site is not making the same mistake it did.
